<h1>The Best Movies According to Miranda </h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Fault in Our Stars </h3>
<p>This movie dives into the world of cancer through a modern, teenage lovestory. I love the characters, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Agustus Waters. It is a good movie to watch when you want a good cry. </p>
<h3>Inception </h3>
<p>This is my favorite action-thriller. It messes with your mind in the perfect way and it will leave you questioning reality. The cinemetography is also incredible. </p>
<h3>Call Me By Your Name </h3>
<p>Movie set in the south of France. The love story is one of a kind and it is very visually appealing. </p>
