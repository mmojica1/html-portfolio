<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Miranda Mojica and I am currently taking an online web developer course. I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, majoring in Neueoscience and possibly minoring in Computer Science. This course has been a lot of fun so far and I can't wait to see what I accomplish by the end of it.
